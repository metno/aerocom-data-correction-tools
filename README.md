# aerocom-data-correction-tools
Tools the [aerocom project](http://aerocom.met.no/) uses to adjust submitted data to the aerocom standard, described along with the [data submission instructions on the aerocom wiki pages](https://wiki.met.no/aerocom/data_submission).
The tools are under development, and aim to correct errors on dimensions, NaN values, axis orientations and descriptions, naming of variables.
Some variables are reconstructed from other variables, reconstruction is documented in history attribute.
